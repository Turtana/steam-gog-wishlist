This Python script goes through your Steam wishlist, checks which games are also available in GOG, and opens their GOG store pages.

Notes:
 - Your Steam wishlist needs to be public
 - Copy your Steam ID. It's the string of numbers at the end of URL when you go to your Steam profile page.
 - The script can open a lot of web pages at the same time, depending on the size of your wishlist. Be prepared for that.
 - You'll probably want to be logged in GOG in your browser BEFORE running this script, so that you can wishlist the games immediately.
